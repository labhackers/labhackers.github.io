A Homelab - or "home laboratory" - is a personalised technology stack where hobbyists and professionals alike can experiment with various hardware configurations and software packages, or have private access to an almost endless range of digital services.  Here's my take on why YOU need one, and what you need to know before you start putting it together:

	<h4>Highlights</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>A Homelab may consist of anything from a single, low-powered device through to a whole network of the latest rack-mounted gear.</li>
		<li>Many find having a homelab is a great way to hone their skills as an Engineer, Developer, or DevOps Professional.</li>
	</ul>
